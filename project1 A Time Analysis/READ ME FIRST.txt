F1 TIMING ANALYSIS

This Python script analyzes Formula 1 lap time data and provides insightful results, 
including individual and overall performance metrics for drivers. 
It processes lap times from multiple race files and outputs tabular 
data for both individual files and combined results.

*Requirements* - Python 3.7 or higher and "pip install tabulate" 

FEATURES

1) Individual Race Analysis: Displays the fastest lap time and average lap time for each driver in a race. 
Highlights the fastest driver for each race.

2) Combined Analysis: Calculates the overall average lap time across all provided files.
Outputs tabular results sorted by the fastest lap times.

3) Driver Information Integration: Uses a drivers file (f1_drivers.txt) to associate driver codes with their names and teams.

4) Flexible Input: Supports multiple lap time files as command-line arguments for batch processing.

5) Error Handling: Handles missing files, invalid data, and other common errors gracefully.

NOTES

1) If a driver code is missing from the f1_drivers.txt file, it will appear as "Unknown" in the results.

2) Invalid lap times in the files (e.g., non-numeric values) will be skipped with a warning.

3) Ensure all lap time files and the drivers file are properly formatted to avoid errors.
